You have chosen to look at the tutorials, great! They are ordered by level of complexity (in terms of line of code). The nice property of Mithril is that it is fairly small which means nothing gets too complicated! 

For those who are completely new, try the [hello world](./hello-world) example. For the adventurous jump straight to the [todo stack](./todo-stack)!
